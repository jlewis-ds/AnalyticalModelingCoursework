# AnalyticalModelingCoursework
Location for R-Markdown files and PDFs of work for Analytical Modeling course

### Uploading coursework from ISYE6501 - Analytical Modeling

### Most work will be in R or RMD form.

HW 5 - Linear regression, back propagation, QQPlots and Boxplots, p-value testing

HW 6 - PCA application, linear regression, p-value testing, Scree plots

HW 7 - Regression tree, random forest, cross validation, R-squared, visualization, logistic regression on credit data, ROC curve, precision/recall

HW 8 - Stepwise regression, LASSO, Elastic net, visualization

HW 9 - Included elsewhere on Github. Airport simulation using SimPy. Simulation, distributions, python, visualization

HW 10 - Imputation methods on missing data. Imputation, regression.

HW 11 - N/A, Spring Break Week

HW 12 - Diet optimization using PuLP and Jupyter notebook. Optimization, linear programming, python, jupyter notebook

HW 13 - Power Company case study. Making recommendations for power cut-offs provided a set of things to consider. Need to analyze who to actually cut-off, likelihood of never paying, and how to optimize worker resources. Clustering, logistic regression, cost/benefits, graph theory, optimization
